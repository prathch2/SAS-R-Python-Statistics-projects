## Case Problem
A researcher is interested in the relationship between influenza and temperature (Â°C) .  
She has compiled data from several locations in the NorthEast and NorthWest of the 
United States and wishes to look at the data.  The data is contained in the Flu1.txt 
file attached.

1. Create an overall scatterplot using PROC PLOT and comment on the relationship.  
2. Create an overall scatterplot using PROC GPLOT and comment on the relationship.  
3. Create an overall scatterplot using PROC SGPLOT and comment on the relationship.   
4. Create a grouped scatterplot using PROC SGPLOT with different colors for each region.
5. Use PROC REG to fit an overall regression line. Report and interpret the coefficients.  
6. Use PROC REG to fit a regression for each region. Report and interpret the R2 value for each model.
