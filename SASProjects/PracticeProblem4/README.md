2. Find the number of crimes by district for 2019 and 2018 separately

3. Find the number of Firearm crimes by Neighborhood by year 

4. Find the number of Firearm crimes by year

5. Use CrimeCode to find the number of Aggravated Assaults by month 

6. Use CrimeCode to find the number of Common Assaults by year 

7.  Create a dataset that has year, number of Aggravated Assaults and number of Common Assaults
