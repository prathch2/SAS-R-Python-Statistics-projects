## Case Study:

A researcher conducting a multi-site study is interested in impulsiveness in individuals who use Cocaine.  This study is conducted at five sites across the country.  All participants in the study were given a urine test to determine whether or not they were cocaine users.  The subjects' gender and age were recorded as well.  Three treatments were given to the participants (at random) as well as general cognitive therapy for impulsive behavior.  All participants receive the cognitive therapy.  The file Impusivity.xls (attached) has the data set in it. Note that the data are recorded on different sheets of the excel document.  She requests the following:

1. The data is stored on the researcher's computer in the directory "C:\TempData".  Your code should read in the data from this directory.  Import all the sheets and make one dataset out of them.
2. Histograms of Age across treatments.
3. Histograms of Age for different gender.
4. Box plots of Impulsivity for each visit time 
5. Box plots of Impulsivity across treatments.You have to construct them for each time visits, i.e., boxplots of imp1 and different treatments, imp2 and different treatments, etc.
6. Box plots of Impulsivity across gender. You have to construct them for each time visits, i.e., for imp1 and different gender, imp2 and different gender, etc.
7. Create a  pdf document that has all of the plots
