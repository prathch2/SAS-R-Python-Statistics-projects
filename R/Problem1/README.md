## Case Problem:

A researcher in Neuroscience is interested in the impulsivity of people.  Impulsivity has been linked with obesity and addiction in humans.  A new drug Repoxodin is being developed to reduce impulsivity.  Subjects are either given the compound or a control and then after the drug takes effect given four different tasks (in random order) that measure impusivity.  The tasks are labeled T1, T2, T3 and T4.  To keep track of the subjects codes are given which correspond to Control (C) or Repoxodin (R), subject number and gender (M) or (F).  For example R15F would correspond to Subject 15 who is given Repoxodin and is Female.

The researcher is in Galveston Texas and has collected the information on paper.  She has sent a picture of the data which is attached.  Since the analysis will be done in R you will need to get this information into R.

Tasks:

1.  Build an R data frame that contains all of the data.  Note you will have to create each column as a vector first and then put them into a dataframe.  The following columns are needed:  Repoxodin or not, Gender, Subject Number, Time1, Time2, Time3 and Time4. 

2.  Create two subsets of the data one for Repoxodin or not (using the subsetting logic)

3.  Create two subsets of the data one for Male and one for Female using the subsetting logic 

4.  Find summaries for each of the five datasets 

5.  Create a new data frame that has the summaries for each of the 5 datasets 

6.  Export the data frame containing the summaries into an Excel (.xlsx) format
