## Case Problem:
Using the Baltimore Violent Crime data attached below complete the following.

1. Create Barplot of SHOOTINGS by month.  Be sure to clearly label everything and comment on which month has the most shootings and which month has the least shootings. 

2. Create a Barplot of the Top 10 neighborhoods for LARCENY.  Sort the Barplot from greatest to least.

3. Create a Barplot of AUTO THEFT versus hour of the day.  Which hours have the most and least auto thefts? 

4. Create a Barplot of the mean AUTO THEFT by day of the Week.  Which days of the week have the most and least mean auto thefts?

5. Create a timeplot (line connected scatterplot) of the number of auto thefts by year.  Does there seem to be a trend?  If so, run a regression and see if the trend is statistically significant.  If it is significant interpret the slope parameter in terms of the problem.
