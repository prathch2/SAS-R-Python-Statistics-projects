## Case Study:

A regional manager is interested in the monthly sales for each store.  He also wants to see how the stores are performing.  

1. Create a scatterplot of revenue versus month with correct titles for the plot.

2. Create a wide dataset with each row corresponding to a store and the remaining columns are the monthly revenue values.

4. Create a summary of revenues for each store.  Note that summaries must include Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, IQR, Min, Max, Q1 and Q3.

Note: The data is stored on the researcher's computer in the directory "C:\TempData".  Your code should read in the data from this directory.
