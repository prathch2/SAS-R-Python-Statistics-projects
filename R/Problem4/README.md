## Case Study:
Draw 1000 samples from the following distributions and create histograms for each.  Be sure to comment about each histogram.  Remember all histograms should have four items addressed.

(a) X ∼ N (0, 1) using rnorm function.  (15 pts)

(b) X ∼ Gamma(2, 3) using the rgamma function. (15 pts)

(c) X+Y where X ∼ N(5,2) and Y ∼ χ2(15).  (15 pts) 

(d) X ∼ Binomial(1, 0.3).  (15 pts) 

(e) Calculate a mean of a vector X = (X1, X2, ..., Xn ) 1000 times, where Xi ~ Binomial(1, 0.4) for n = 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and create a histogram of the means. Each n should be dealt with separately. For example, you draw 1000 samples of size n = 2 (you may use for() loop for that). Every time a sample is drawn, you calculate its mean. Once you will end up with n means, you create a histogram of those means. Then repeat for n = 5, 10, etc.  There should be 6 separate histograms with comments for each.  Restrict the x-axis to stay at 0 to 1 for all plots.  Comment on the differences between plots as n increases
