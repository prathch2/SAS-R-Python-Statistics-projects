## Case Problem:
Conduct 1000 two-sample two-sided t-tests for the associated rows of “x”and “y”. (e.g., for the first test, the two samples are “x[1,]” and “y[1,]”, for the second test, the two samples are “x[2,]” and “y[2,]”,etc.). Calculate the total number of rejections of the 1000 tests. (Use significant level α = 0.05)  - 40 points


Part 2. Write a code to find all values of x for which the functions below are zero. In other words, find the roots of those function using Newton's method, report the starting values that you used and the number of iterations. Plotting the function might help in selection of the initial values.  You must use a while loop to do the computations.  Simply using a built-in R function is not acceptable.  

a) (30 pts)   f(x)=2ex2 −1   

b) (30 pts)  f(x) = x2 − 251/187x + 82/187
